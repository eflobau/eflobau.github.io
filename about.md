### Mexican bio-digital cowboy

I'm a modern mexican biologist, using my computer as a horse, I'm a cowboy in the rodeo of biological data. 

Besides computational, systems and synthetic biology, I'm very interested in DIYbio! In my spare time I run a community lab called Plasmid Lab in the Fab Lab Yucatán in Mérida, México. If you want to talk about any of these topics or have a question regarding any of the posts, don't hesitate to contact me !
